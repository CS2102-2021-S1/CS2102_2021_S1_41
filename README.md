## W6 Project Deliverables
### 1. ER Diagram Model: Pet Caring Service (PCS) Application
![ER Diagram](docs/images/ER_Diagram_Project.jpg)

### 2. Constraints
1. Users belong to either Admin, Pet Owners or Caretakers (Covering constraint). Users can belong to multiple groups (Overlapping Constraint).

1. Price_List of Care_Takers will record down the available pet types the Caretakers are capable of handling.

1. Part-time Caretakers have to specify their own availability for the current year + the next year. For full-time Caretakers, they are assumed to be available during working hours (weekdays) unless they are on leave.

1. Leaves will be documented in the Leave entity, where a start date and end date is specified. PCS Admin will approve/reject the leave based on availability of Care Takers

1. Leave must not be approved by the applicant him/herself

1. Attribute EmployeeType of Care_Takers will record whether they are full-time or part-time Caretakers.

1. Pet Owners will be able to search Caretakers based on criteria - for example, filtering by rating or maximum price, and select manually if needed.

1. Automatic contract selection based on the same/similar area and availability of caretaker.

1. Underperforming full-time caretakers is defined as a full-time caretaker that works less than the average number of pet-days per month of all full-time caretakers, or one that works less than 60 pet-days per month. ie min(average, 60).

1. Successful bidders are defined as the highest bidder by price, if there are multiple bidders for the same caretaker for the same day.



### 3. Non-trivial constraints with triggers

1. Average rating for Caretakers

1. When bid by any Pet Owner, a full-time Caretaker will always accept the job immediately if possible

1. If Caretaker applies for leave, their availability will automatically be set to not available for the range of the dates of the leave.

### 4. Justification of any serial type

1. user_id
    * UserID can be tracked easily with natural increments, as well as to identify which role the user is taking. Hence, one user may take multiple roles, for example, PCS_Admin may also be a Pet_Owner. Each user_id shall be unique and generated by the system to ensure that no userIDs are duplicated.
    
1. pet_id
    * pet_id can be tracked easily with natural increments. Each pet_id shall be unique and generated by system to ease the tagging of each pet using a pet_id.

1. agreement_id
    * Agreements increments naturally as bids come. This allows for each agreement to be unique.

1. payment_id
    * payment_id and agreement_id are total participating entities with key constraint, hence payment_id follows agreement_id to have a serial type.
